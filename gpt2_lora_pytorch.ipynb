    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to be effective at a variety of NLP\n",
    "tasks. An LLM is first pre-trained on a large corpus of text in a\n",
    "self-supervised fashion. Pre-training helps LLMs learn general-purpose knowledge,\n",
    "such as statistical relationships between words. An LLM can then be fine-tuned\n",
    "on a downstream task of interest (such as sentiment analysis).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, LLMs are extremely large in size, and we don't need to train all the\n",
    "parameters in the model while fine-tuning, especially because datasets on which\n",
    "the model is fine-tuned are relatively small. Another way of saying this is\n",
    "that LLMs are over-parametrized for fine-tuning. This is where\n",
    "[Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685) comes in; it\n",
    "significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters. This results in a\n",
    "decrease in training time and GPU memory usage, while maintaining the quality\n",
    "of the outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we will explain LoRA in technical terms, show how the technical\n",
    "explanation translates to code, use PyTorch and Hugging Face's PEFT library to implement\n",
    "[GPT-2 model](https://huggingface.co/gpt2) and fine-tune\n",
    "it on the next token prediction task using LoRA. We will compare LoRA GPT-2\n",
    "with a fully fine-tuned GPT-2 in terms of the quality of the generated text,\n",
    "training time and GPU memory usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: This example runs on PyTorch with CUDA support optimized for Linux systems\n",
    "with CUDA 12.x compatibility."

    "## LoRA GPT-2\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we discuss the technical details of LoRA, build a LoRA GPT-2\n",
    "model using PEFT library, fine-tune it and generate text.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What exactly is LoRA?\n",
    "\n",
    "LoRA is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique for LLMs. It freezes the\n",
    "weights of the LLM, and injects trainable rank-decomposition matrices. Let's\n",
    "understand this more clearly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume we have an `n x n` pre-trained dense layer (or weight matrix), `W0`. We\n",
    "initialize two dense layers, `A` and `B`, of shapes `n x rank`, and `rank x n`,\n",
    "respectively. `rank` is much smaller than `n`. In the paper, values between 1\n",
    "and 4 are shown to work well.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### LoRA equation\n",
    "\n",
    "The original equation is `output = W0x + b0`, where `x` is the input, `W0` and\n",
    "`b0` are the weight matrix and bias terms of the original dense layer (frozen).\n",
    "The LoRA equation is: `output = W0x + b0 + BAx`, where `A` and `B` are the\n",
    "rank-decomposition matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "LoRA is based on the idea that updates to the weights of the pre-trained\n",
    "language model have a low \"intrinsic rank\" since pre-trained language models are\n",
    "over-parametrized. Predictive performance of full fine-tuning can be replicated\n",
    "even by constraining `W0`'s updates to low-rank decomposition matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/f4TFqMi.png\" alt=\"lora_diagram\" height=\"250\"/>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Number of trainable parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's do some quick math. Suppose `n` is 768, and `rank` is 4. `W0` has\n",
    "`768 x 768 = 589,824` parameters, whereas the LoRA layers, `A` and `B` together\n",
    "have `768 x 4 + 4 x 768 = 6,144` parameters. So, for the dense layer, we go from\n",
    "`589,824` trainable parameters to `6,144` trainable parameters!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why does LoRA reduce memory footprint?\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though the total number of parameters increase (since we are adding LoRA\n",
    "layers), the memory footprint reduces, because the number of trainable\n",
    "parameters reduces. Let's dive deeper into this.\n",
    "\n",
    "The memory usage of a model can be split into four parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Model memory: This is the memory required to store the model weights. This\n",
    "will be slightly higher for LoRA than GPT-2.\n",
    "- Forward pass memory: This mostly depends on batch size, sequence length, etc.\n",
    "We keep this constant for both models for a fair comparison.\n",
    "- Backward pass memory: This is the memory required to store the gradients.\n",
    "Note that the gradients are computed only for the trainable parameters.\n",
    "- Optimizer memory: This is the memory required to store the optimizer state.\n",
    "For example, the Adam optimizer stores the \"1st moment vectors\" and\n",
    "\"2nd moment vectors\" for the trainable parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since, with LoRA, there is a huge reduction in the number of trainable\n",
    "parameters, the optimizer memory and the memory required to store the gradients\n",
    "for LoRA is much less than GPT-2. This is where most of the memory savings\n",
    "happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why is LoRA so popular?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reduces GPU memory usage;\n",
    "- Faster training; and\n",
    "- No additional inference latency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create LoRA Model using PEFT\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use Hugging Face's PEFT library to create a LoRA version of GPT-2.\n",
    "The PEFT library handles all the complexity of injecting LoRA adapters into\n",
    "the transformer layers automatically."
